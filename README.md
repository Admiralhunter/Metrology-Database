# Metrology-Database
A script to upload data residing in excel files to a SQLite database. It will automatically create the necessary table for each excel file if they don't already exist. it will also check the integrity of the data of the database and email the necessary individuals if the program runs into an error or bad data at a consistent schedule (currently every 5 minutes).
The program will search for a "-" in the first column to determine where the first data set starts. It knows that all rows above that are headers for the columns in the table.
It will then grab the data, place it into a dataframe and then check the SQLite database for a table that matches the parts. If no table exists then one is created and populated with the data. Finally the Data is the verified to not have too many or too late datapoints for each column and that the values are not negative (except for a few exceptions). Finally the database is saved and the script terminates until the next time that it is called.
The script also has a built in function to send an automated email to specific users to alert of errors.
